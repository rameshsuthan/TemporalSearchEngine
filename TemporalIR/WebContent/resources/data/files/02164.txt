Malaria presents a diagnostic challenge to laboratories in most countries. This paper attempts to review the current methodology and approach to the diagnosis of malaria in a practical and helpful way for the laboratory and for the physician caring for the patient. The urgency and importance of obtaining results quickly from the examination of blood samples from patients with suspected acute malaria render some of the more sensitive methods for malaria diagnosis impractical for routine laboratory use. For the purposes of this review, laboratory methods that require more than 1 h to provide a clear diagnosis of malaria are not considered rapid tests, although they may be considered reference procedures.
