Ebola is not spread through casual contact, officials with the county Health and Human Services Agency said. The virus is spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids of a sick person or exposure to objects such as needles that have been contaminated.
"If a case of Ebola were to happen locally, the county of San Diego has well-trained staff that would investigate and locate any recent contacts of the person," Wooten said. "We would need to find everyone who had direct contact with the person when they were showing symptoms and isolate these contacts if they were also showing symptoms to stop the spread of the disease."
