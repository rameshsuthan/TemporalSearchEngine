Malaria is a potentially fatal tropical disease that's caused by a parasite known as Plasmodium. It's spread through the bite of an infected female mosquito.The infected person may have feverish attacks, influenza-like symptoms, tiredness, diarrhoea or a whole range of other symptoms. Malaria should always be suspected if these symptoms occur within the first year of return from an infected area; a test should be carried out to exclude the possibility of malaria as soon as possible.
