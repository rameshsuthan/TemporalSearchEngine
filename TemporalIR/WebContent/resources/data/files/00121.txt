Symptoms of endemic typhus develop within about one to two weeks after initial infection and may include a high fever (about 105 F), headache, malaise, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a rash that begins about four to seven days on the chest and abdomen after the initial symptoms above develop; the rash often spreads. Some patients may also have a cough and abdominal,joint, andback pain. Symptoms may last for about two weeks and, barring complications or death (less than 2% die), symptoms abate. However, epidemic typhus symptoms, although initially similar to endemic typhus, become more severe. The rash may cover the entire body except the palms of the hands and the bottoms of the feet. Patients may develop additional symptoms of bleeding into the skin (petechiae), delirium, stupor, hypotension, and shock, which can cause their death
