We believe that Ebola’s first offensive maneuver is the targeting of certain types of immune cells which would normally be our body’s first line of defense against illness. The virus attacks and infects the body’s dendritic cells which are responsible for the activation of T cells (the white blood cells we use to fight infection) which would normally kill off the infected cells before they could spread. With the dendritic cells compromised, the T cells are not activated and the virus begins to multiply in a very rapid fashion. Ebola also, similarly too many other viruses, inhibits interferon which is a molecule that cells make use of to further retard viral reproduction.
