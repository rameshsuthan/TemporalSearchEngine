The process starts off slowly. Once patients contract Ebola, the virus begins to mow down their immune system, killing off the body’s T-lymphocyte cells, the same ones affected by the AIDS virus. However, Ebola is far more aggressive than AIDS and begins tearing through several types of immune cells far more quickly. The virus produces several proteins, one of which blocks immune cells from signaling antibodies to attack. Once the patient’s first line of defense against pathogens is dismantled, the virus can begin replicating.
