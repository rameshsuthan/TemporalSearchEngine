The virus is known to be systemic, which means the infection attacks every tissue and organ of the body except the skeletal muscles and bones. The virus is also characterized by hemorrhaging and blood clotting. Although it is yet to be discovered how the virus attacks human cells, it is hypothesized that they are able to release certain proteins that can weaken the responses of the bodyâ€™s immune system.
