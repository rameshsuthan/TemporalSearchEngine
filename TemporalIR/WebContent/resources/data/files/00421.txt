The bacteria which cause endemic and epidemic typhus are not transmitted directly by bites, but by contamination of the bite site with infected louse faeces which are then inoculated by human excoriation. They then parasitise the endothelial cells of blood vessels, causing a multisystem vasculitis. Orientia tsutsugamushi is transmitted by the ovaries of trombiculid mites. The offspring infected mites are known as chiggers, and pass the infection directly to humans.
