Perhaps no virus strikes as much fear in people as Ebola, the cause of a deadly outbreak in West Africa.
The World Health Organization (WHO) reports more than 13,000 confirmed or suspected cases of Ebola, mostly in the countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, as of Nov. 2. More than 4,800 people have died in the largest Ebola outbreak ever recorded.
