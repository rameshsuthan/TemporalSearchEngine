Malaria causes around 600,000 deaths each year, mainly in children in sub-Saharan Africa, and families, governments, and donors spend considerable amounts of money on diagnosis, treatment and prevention. To ensure this money is spent wisely, The Cochrane Collaboration conduct independent reviews of the evidence in prevention and treatment.  
Prompt diagnosis and treatment with effective drugs will reduce malaria deaths.
