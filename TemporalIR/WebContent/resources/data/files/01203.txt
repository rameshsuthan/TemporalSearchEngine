The risks in viral isolation have led to the development of various modalities that better lend themselves to laboratories with limited containment systems. Tests used to confirm the diagnosis of Ebola virus infection include an immunohistochemical test performed on formalin-fixed postmortem skin taken from patients who have died of Ebola hemorrhagic fever. This test is safe, sensitive, and specific, and it can be used for diagnosis and surveillance.
