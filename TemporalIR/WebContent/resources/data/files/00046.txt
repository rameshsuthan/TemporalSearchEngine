INTRODUCTION — The family Filoviridae consists of two genera, the Ebola and Marburg viruses, which are among the most virulent pathogens in humans [1]. The Zaire species of Ebola virus is the causative agent of the 2014-2015 epidemic in West Africa, in which the case fatality rate has been reported to be as high as 70 percent [2]; rates in earlier outbreaks have reached 80 to 90 percent [3]. Marburg virus has caused a similar disease in a smaller number of outbreaks in Central Africa [4]. The epidemiology and pathogenesis of Ebola virus disease will be presented here, including new knowledge emerging from the 2014-2015 epidemic of Ebola virus disease in West Africa. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Ebola virus disease are discussed elsewhere. (See "Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Ebola virus disease" and "Treatment and prevention of Ebola virus disease".)
