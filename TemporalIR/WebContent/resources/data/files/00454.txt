When asked how long it would take someone to clinically recover from the Ebola virus, Dr. Lahey stated that you could expect a few week recovery time. It generally takes one to two weeks for symptoms of the disease to appear, on average, and from that point death generally occurs within a couple of weeks. If you are lucky enough to survive, after this few week period you could be considered as recovered.
