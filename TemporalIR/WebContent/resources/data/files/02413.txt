Other symptoms of malaria include headache, nausea, aches and pains all over the body (especially the back and abdomen), and an abnormally large spleen. Convulsions or loss of consciousness may occur if malaria affects the brain. If it affects the kidneys, the amount of urine produced might be abnormally low. In falciparum malaria, caused by the Plasmodium falciparum parasite, the episode of fever and chills is especially intense, and this variety may be fatal in about 20% of cases.
