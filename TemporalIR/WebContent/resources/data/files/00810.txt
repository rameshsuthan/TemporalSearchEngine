Do infected people need to be isolated?

Isolation is not necessary with patients with malaria and they do not need to be excluded from either work or school, as the disease is not contagious. If you do have a history of malaria you should not donate blood or organs.

Can infected people be treated?

If diagnosed early malaria can be effectively treated, a delay in treatment can have serious consequences. If left untreated malaria can be harder to treat, resulting in organ failure, coma or even death.
