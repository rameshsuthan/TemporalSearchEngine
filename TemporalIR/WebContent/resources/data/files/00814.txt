Without treatment, death may occur in 10-50% with epidemic typhus, 4-40% with scrub typhus, and around 2% with endemic typhus.
Prognosis[2]
Uncomplicated cases that are promptly diagnosed and treated do very well and usually make a full recovery.
Complicated or delayed cases have a higher risk of complications but still do well on the whole, dependent on comorbidity and degree of immunity from previous infections.
Before the advent of antibiotics, mortality for epidemic typhus was as high as 60%. Indeed Ricketts (after whom the genus Rickettsia is named) died of typhus after exposure during his laboratory work. It is now thought to be between 3-4% if correct treatment is given - deaths still occur due to delayed diagnosis. Murine typhus has a mortality rate of between 1-4%.
The highest mortality is seen in adults, particularly the elderly and malnourished.
