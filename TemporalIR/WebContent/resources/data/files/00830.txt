LBOH Action Steps

This form does not need to be submitted to the MDPH with the case report form. It is for LBOH use and is meant as a quick-reference guide to cholera case investigation activities.

LBOH staff should follow these steps when cholera is suspected or confirmed in the community. For more detailed information, including disease epidemiology, reporting, case investigation, and follow-up, refer to the preceding chapter.
