The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) created a poster to explain how large droplets expelled by someone who is very sick could potentially spread the virus. They stress that Ebola is not airborne. You cannot get it by breathing in air after a sick person coughs, talks, sneezes or exhales. Ebola virus does not float in the air. But if a person who is very sick with Ebola expels droplets from their body, those droplets could potentially spread Ebola if they get directly into someone's eyes, nose or mouth. Infection might also happen if those droplets are transferred into someone's eyes, nose or mouth via indirect methods (if they touch a contaminated object or surface, then their eyes/nose/mouth.)
