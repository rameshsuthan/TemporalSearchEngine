The difficulty is that Ebola has a relatively long incubation period.  Although most people show symptoms within four to seven days after infection, some do not show them for up to 21 days. Dr. Craig Spencer, the physician who arrived in New York on Oct. 17, might have been able to pass an Ebola test that day. He did not detect a fever � a classic, although imperfect, warning sign � until Thursday.  Kaci Hickox, the nurse who was forced into quarantine at Newark airport on Friday, despite having had a negative Ebola test, might still develop Ebola � or she might never.
