The outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) occurring in West Africa since December 2013 will mark the history – however brief – of the viruses. Occurring for the first time outside its original home – the Central African rainforest – this epidemic of EVD appears as the deadliest and longest of all those known so far. At this time (August 15th, 2014), more than 1,250 deaths have been reported, i.e. five times more than during the worst previous outbreak. In addition, its rapid propagation has led the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare on August 8th that EVD represent a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern” and urged the international community to take action to stop the spread. Finally, for the first time, in response to the severity of the situation, WHO agreed the use of experimental treatment against the Ebola.
