Malaria can begin with flu-like symptoms. In the early stages, infection from P. falciparum is similar to infection from P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale. You may have no symptoms or symptoms that are less severe if you are partially immune to malaria.
The time from the initial malaria infection until symptoms appear (incubation period) typically ranges from:2
	•	9 to 14 days for Plasmodium (P.) falciparum.
	•	12 to 18 days for P. vivax and P. ovale.
	•	18 to 40 days for P. malariae.
	•	11 to 12 days for P. knowlesi.
Symptoms can appear in 7 days. And the time between exposure and signs of illness may sometimes be as long as 8 to 10 months with P. vivax and P. ovale.
The incubation period may be longer if you are taking medicine to prevent infection (chemoprophylaxis) or because you have some immunity due to previous infections
