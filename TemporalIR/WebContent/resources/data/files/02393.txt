In a statement, the hospital said an electronic records glitch between the nurse who questioned Duncan and the doctor who treated him led to the lapse. The nurse noted in Duncan’s electronic chart that he said he had arrived from Africa. But the information was not transferred to the doctor’s electronic medical notes. Officials say they are now using a new process to record and share patient information.The hospital statement did not say why the doctor failed to question Duncan about the countries he had visited before coming to the U.S. A hospital spokesman did not respond Friday to an interview request.
