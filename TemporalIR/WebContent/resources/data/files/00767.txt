When should I suspect cholera?
You should suspect cholera in any patient presenting with severe watery diarrhea and vomiting
with severe dehydration, particularly after recent travel from Haiti. The patient may complain of
painful cramping in the legs due to electrolyte disturbances. Clinical suspicion should be
increased, and milder diarrheal illnesses are more suspect, in persons returning from Haiti, or in
persons with a recent history of ingestion of raw seafood. The incubation period of cholera is
between two hours and five days.
