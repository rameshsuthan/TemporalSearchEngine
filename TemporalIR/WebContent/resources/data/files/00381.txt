Etiology
Epidemic typhus results from infection by Rickettsia prowazekii, a Gram negative, obligate intracellular bacterium. At least two strains can be distinguished by genetic analysis. One strain is found only in humans; the other also occurs in flying squirrels in the United States.
Incubation Period
The incubation period is 1 to 2 weeks; most infections become evident after 12 days.
