Typhus fever or typhus is an acute infection caused by various species of the bacteria Rickettsia. Forms of typhus depend on the particular species of bacteria responsible for the infection.Epidemic typhus is caused by Rickettsia prowazekii and is transmitted from human to human by the body louse. Rickettsia bacteria may remain in the body for months or years after treatment. When epidemic typhus recurs several years after the initial attack, this condition is called Brill-Zinsser disease. Native (endemic), mouse (murine), and flea-borne typhus (caused by Rickettsia typhi) are spread to humans by mouse or rat fleas. Mites infected with Orienta (formerly Rickettsia) tsutsugamushi spread scrub typhus or tsutsugamushi disease.
