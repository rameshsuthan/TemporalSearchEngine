Despite the low incidence of infection, the lethality and potential for short-range aerosol transmission of Ebola virus in patients with advanced illness makes the virus a severe biological threat. This is compounded by the possibility of the virus being obtained from the wild for use as a biological weapon, something Japanese terrorist cult Aum Shinrikyo once unsuccessfully attempted [5]. As of the present, there are no licensed vaccines or specific antiviral treatments available for Ebola virus infections, with significant progress only made in the development of vaccines for nonhuman primates [34]
