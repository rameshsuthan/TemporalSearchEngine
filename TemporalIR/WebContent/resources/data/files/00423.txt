With scrub typhus, the individual may report a black, crusted bite, tender lymph nodes, eye pain and redness (conjunctivitis), and a short-term rash. However, symptoms of scrub typhus are milder and less specific than other forms of typhus, making this disease difficult to diagnose, especially since it is rare in the US.
