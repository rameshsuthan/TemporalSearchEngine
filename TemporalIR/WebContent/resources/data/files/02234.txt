When patients get an early diagnosis, they have a better chance of responding to the various therapies now available. Those include experimental anti-viral drugs, like ZMapp, and blood transfusions from Ebola survivors that contain antibodies to the virus. The treatments also include more mundane (but absolutely essential) medication to help restore lost fluids and to keep electrolyte levels steady, sustaining patients for long enough to let their immune systems overcome the virus. (Julia Belluz of Vox has written a terrific explanation of the treatments and how they work, if you want to read one.)
