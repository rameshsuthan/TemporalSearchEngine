Symptoms of malaria 

Symptoms of malaria can develop as quickly as seven days after you are bitten by an infected mosquito.
Typically, the time between being infected and when symptoms start (incubation period) is seven to 18 days, depending on the specific parasite you are infected with. However, in some cases it can take up to a year for symptoms to develop.
The initial symptoms of malaria are flu-like and include a high temperature (fever), headache, sweats, chills and vomiting. These symptoms are often mild and can sometimes be difficult to identify as malaria.
With some types of malaria, the fever occurs in four to eight hour cycles. During these cycles, you feel cold at first with shivering that lasts for up to an hour. You then develop a fever that lasts for two to six hours, accompanied by severe sweating.
Other symptoms of malaria can include: 
muscle pains
diarrhoea
generally feeling unwell
