The good news is, cholera is easy to treat if it's caught early. People who have mild to moderate cases usually get better within a week. Even people with severe cases of cholera recover fully in a week or so if they get medical care.Cholera is mostly found in the tropics — in particular Asia, Africa, Latin America, India, and the Middle East. It's rare in the United States, but people can still get it. People who travel from countries where the infection is more common can bring cholera into the U.S. Some people in the U.S. have become sick from eating raw and undercooked shellfish from the Gulf of Mexico.
