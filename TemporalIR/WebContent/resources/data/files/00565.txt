DIAGNOSIS — Although there are no approved specific therapies for Ebola virus disease, it is essential to make the diagnosis as early as possible, in order to initiate supportive measures before the development of irreversible shock and to institute infection control procedures. Thus, providers should ask patients who present with fever and/or other symptoms consistent with Ebola virus disease if they have travelled to the epidemic area or had contact with a patient with possible Ebola virus disease within 21 days prior to the onset of symptoms
