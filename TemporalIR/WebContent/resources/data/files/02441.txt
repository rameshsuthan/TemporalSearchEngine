If you have one of the three less severe types of malaria, you’re likely to be treated with chloroquine tablets (eg Avloclor, Malarivon or Nivaquine). It’s safe to take chloroquine if you're pregnant.
If you have malaria caused by P. vivax or P. ovale, you will need treatment to stop the infection coming back. This is because parasites can stay in your liver. You’re likely to be given primaquine after you finish taking chloroquine. If you’re pregnant, your doctor will usually advise that you wait until you have given birth before you take primaquine.
