Globally, the World Health Organization estimates that in 2010, 219 million clinical cases of malaria occurred, and 660,000 people died of malaria, most of them children in Africa. Because malaria causes so much illness and death, the disease is a great drain on many national economies. Since many countries with malaria are already among the poorer nations, the disease maintains a vicious cycle of disease and poverty.
