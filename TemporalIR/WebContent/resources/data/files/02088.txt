The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working closely with the World Health Organization, state and local health departments, clinicians, and other partners to better understand and manage the public health risks posed by Ebola virus disease (EVD).  As of October 30, 2014, five EVD patients have been evacuated from West Africa for further medical care, and two imported cases and two secondary cases of Ebola virus disease have been identified in the United States. The purpose of this document is to provide updated information about EVD to clinicians working in U.S. hospitals and health clinics.
