The first symptoms of malaria are similar to those of flu. You may have:
•	a fever
•	a headache
•	aching muscles
•	a tummy ache, diarrhoea and vomiting – especially in children
•	a lack of energy
•	loss of appetite
•	a cough
Symptoms of malaria include fever and flu-like illness, including shaking chills, headache, muscle aches, and tiredness. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may also occur. Malaria may cause anemia and jaundice (yellow coloring of the skin and eyes) because of the loss of red blood cells. Symptoms usually appear between 10 and 15 days after the mosquito bite. For most people, symptoms begin 10 days to 4 weeks after infection, although a person may feel ill as early as 7 days or as late as 1 year later.
