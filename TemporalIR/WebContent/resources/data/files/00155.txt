Until recently, only the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a few other medical school laboratories could do Ebola tests. Now every state health department laboratory can, and more hospitals are getting them.  But the tests are not something to be done on tabletops in airports by laypeople.  PCR tests are notorious for cross-contamination errors, and the blood of actual Ebola victims is extremely dangerous and must be treated as a biohazard.
