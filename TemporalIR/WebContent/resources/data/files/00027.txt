There were a number of suspected cases in September. There was even an MD in /r/medicine who made a post about how he was nervous because a patient of his was being tested for ebola. The thing with suspected cases is, they're entirely subjective. Now that we have one confirmed case in the US and the first hospital screwed up, ebola is gonna be on every ER docs mind and there's gonna be a ton of suspected cases. I think you'll have trouble tracking all of them, and I think it will become more routine to test for ebola to the point where most won't even make the news
