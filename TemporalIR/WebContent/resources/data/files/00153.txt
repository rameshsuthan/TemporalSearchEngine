There are rapid, cheap tests for Ebola, based on detecting antibodies to the virus, but they work only when a victim has already been ill for several days. Antibodies are produced by the bodyï¿½s counterattack on the virus, and are therefore not detectable until that counterattack is well underway. By that time, the victim might have infected others.
