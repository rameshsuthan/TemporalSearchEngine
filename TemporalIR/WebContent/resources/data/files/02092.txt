Patients with fatal disease usually develop more severe clinical signs early during infection and die typically between days 6 and 16 of complications including multi-organ failure and septic shock (mean of 7.5 days from symptom-onset to death during the current outbreak in West Africa). In non-fatal cases, patients may have fever for several days and improve, typically around day 6. Patients that survive can have a prolonged convalescence.
