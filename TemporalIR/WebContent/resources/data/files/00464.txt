The type of malaria will impact on the severity and length of the infection as wellâ€”P. falciparum is the most severe kind, and can result quickly in death if not treated promptly, whereas less rapidly progressing forms of malaria, such as P. malariae, may persist for longer but not cause severe disease. For most cases of uncomplicated malaria, once the appropriate form of treatment is started, the patient will start to recover within a couple of days.
