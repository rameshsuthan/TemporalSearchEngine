Cholera control and prevention

The high burden of disease highlights the need of interventions to prevent and control enteric diseases. Cholera is a controllable disease provided several actions are taken in the short, medium and long terms.
Water sanitation

Being a fecal-oral highly transmissible water-borne disease, water sanitation including clean water supply, sewage treatment, other sanitation infrastructures, awareness and adoption of hygienic practices represent the necessary conditions for its elimination. Even if improved water and sanitation are the mainstay of the prevention and a sustained control of cholera, those goals need time and long term investment to be achieved, especially in impoverished countries where enteric diseases are endemic. 

Therefore, cholera control also relies on a series of activities, including
Â­Epidemiologic surveillance for early case detection
Information, training and education of both health care professionals and the population
Appropriate patient care (rehydration, antibiotics) allowing easy and early access to dedicated medical centers.
 
Vaccination

Eventually vaccination will also become an option for populations living in high-risk areas. In endemic countries, immunization of the entire population is not warranted, and the focus should be done on at-risk populations such as young children, or vulnerable people such as pregnant women and HIV positive persons. However, more massive vaccination campaigns could be carried out to prevent and/or control epidemics.
The WHO recommends that immunization be used with other prevention and control strategies in areas where the disease is endemic and in areas at risk of outbreaks. The use of enteric vaccines as an additional public health tool to improve control activities appears to be a promising strategy for endemic settings and vulnerable people living in high-risk areas.
