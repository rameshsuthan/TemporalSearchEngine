Signs and symptoms of Ebola[12]
The length of time between exposure to the virus and the development of symptoms (incubation period) is between 2 to 21 days,[1][12] usually between 4 to 10 days.[13] However, recent estimates based on mathematical models predict that around 5% of cases may take greater than 21 days to develop.[14]
