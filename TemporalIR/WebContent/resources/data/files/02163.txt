Malaria RDT use by small organizations and individuals
Malaria RDTs are frequently marketed to individuals, such as travellers, and to small organizations in endemic areas. They may form a useful adjunct to medical care in these situations providing the user is well trained in RDT preparation and interpretation, and understands the limitations of the tests.
