Five commercially available rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for cholera show promise for use in field conditions, but need further study. This is the recommendation from a newly published review that took the first step in assessing developments in commercialised diagnostic tools. The authors recommend an independent assessment of these products, including technical improvements and production to trigger early detection of cholera epidemics. They also say that stringent standardization is needed to evaluate these and more tests.
