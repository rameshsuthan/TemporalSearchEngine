EPIDEMIOLOGY

All age groups are at risk for rickettsial infections during travel to endemic areas. Transmission is increased during outdoor activities in the spring and summer months when ticks and fleas are most active. However, infection can occur throughout the year. Because of the 5- to 14-day incubation period for most rickettsial diseases, tourists may not necessarily experience symptoms during their trip, and onset may coincide with their return home or develop within a week after returning.

The most commonly diagnosed rickettsial diseases in travelers are usually in the spotted fever or typhus groups, but travelers may acquire a wide range of rickettsioses, including emerging and newly recognized species (Table 3-18). Game hunting and traveling to southern Africa from November through April are risk factors for African tick-bite fever in travelers, which is the most frequently reported travel-associated rickettsiosis. However, Mediterranean spotted fever infections occur over an even larger region and can be quite severe.

Rickettsialpox, transmitted by house-mouse mites, circulates in urban centers in Ukraine, South Africa, Korea, the Balkan states, and the United States. Outbreaks of rickettsialpox most often occur after contact with infected rodents and their mites, especially during natural die-offs or exterminations of infected rodents that cause the mites to seek out new hosts, including humans. The agent may spill over and occasionally be found in other wild rodent populations.
