Some of the difference in cost may be due to New York’s role in receiving people from West Africa, where most of the Ebola outbreak has been concentrated. Unlike Dallas, New York has one of the five U.S. airports designed by the Department of Homeland Security as a destination for passengers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.As of Dec. 2, the city’s health department was monitoring 222 people who had traveled to the city from West Africa in the previous 21 days, a precautionary measure. The department had also been keeping an eye on 114 health-care workers who treated Spencer until the monitoring period ended for the last one this week.
