Prevention
Avoid areas where you might encounter rat fleas or lice. Good sanitation and public health measures reduce the rat population.
Measures to get rid of lice when an infection has been found include:
Bathing
Boiling clothes or avoiding infested clothing for at least 5 days (lice will die without feeding on blood)
Using insecticides (10% DDT, 1% malathion, or 1% permethrin)
