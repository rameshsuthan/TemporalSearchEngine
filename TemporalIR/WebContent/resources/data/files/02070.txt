Malaria is endemic in Liberia but due to the incredible demand of the Ebola outbreak on the medical system, basic health care such as malaria treatment is now very difficult, if not impossible, to find in Monrovia. MSF’s program is designed to both prevent and treat new malaria cases, and to minimize the number of people with malaria at Ebola treatment centers.
