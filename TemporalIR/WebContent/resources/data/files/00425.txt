Infection of S. typhi leads to the development of typhoid, or enteric fever. This disease is characterized by the sudden onset of a sustained and systemic fever, severe headache, nausea, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms include constipation or diarrhea, enlargement of the spleen, possible development of meningitis, and/or general malaise. Untreated typhoid fever cases result in mortality rates ranging from 12-30% while treated cases allow for 99% survival.
