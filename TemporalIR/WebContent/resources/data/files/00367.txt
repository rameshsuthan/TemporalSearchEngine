After hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, liver injury and viral control have been thought to result from lysis of infected hepatocytes by virus-specific cytotoxic T cells. Patients are usually studied only after developing significant liver injury, and so the viral and immune events during the incubation phase of disease have not been defined. During a single-source outbreak of HBV infection, we identified pa- tients before the onset of symptomatic hepatitis. Although a rise in alanine transam- inase (ALT) levels was present at the time of the initial fall in HBV-DNA levels, maximal reduction in virus level occurred before significant liver injury. Direct ex vivo quantification of HBV-specific CD4􏰆 and CD8􏰆 cells, by using human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I tetramers and intracellular cytokine staining, showed that adaptive immune mecha- nisms are present during the incubation phase. The results suggest that the pat- tern of reduction in HBV replication is not directly propor- tional to tissue injury during acute hepatitis B in humans. Furthermore, because virus-specific immune responses and significant reductions in viral replication are seen during the incubation phase, it is likely that the immune events central to viral control occur before symptomatic disease.
