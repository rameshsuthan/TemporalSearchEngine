A group of scientists have discovered a new virus that is related to some of the deadliest viruses to primates (including humans). The virus was isolated in bats in northern Spain.
The new virus is quite similar to another filovirus, the Ebola virus, which had 90 percent mortality in the first outbreak in humans, recorded in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) in 1976
