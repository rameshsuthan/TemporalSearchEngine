There are also innumerable instances which prove the communication of cholera, by individual cases of the disease, in the most convincing manner.  Instances such as the following seem free from every source of fallacy.  I called lately to inquire respecting the death of Mrs. Gore, the wife of a Tabourer, from cholera, at New Leigharn Road, Streatham (lower right).  I found that a son of deceased had been living and working at Chelsea. He came home ill with a bowel complaint, of which he died in a day or two.  His death took place on August 18th.  His mother, who attended on him, was taken ill on the next day, and died the day following (August 20th).  There were no other deaths from cholera registered in any of the metropolitan districts, down to the 26th August, within two or three miles of the above place; the nearest being at Brixton (center right), Norwood (lower left), or Lower Tooting (lower center).
