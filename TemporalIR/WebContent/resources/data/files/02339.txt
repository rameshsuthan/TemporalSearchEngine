Both epidemic and murine typhus are found around the world. However, epidemic typhus is most common in situations where poor hygiene and crowded living conditions exist. Epidemic typhus is rare in the United States. Murine typhus is most common in rat-infested areas. It is the only type of typhus that occurs regularly in the United States, but fewer than 100 cases a year are reported, mainly in Texas and California.
