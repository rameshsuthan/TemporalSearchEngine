The standard treatment for severe P. falciparum malaria is quinine, which will be injected directly into your blood through a vein (intravenously). Once you're well enough, you can have the rest of your treatment as tablets that you swallow. If quinine isn’t effective, you may be given a medicine called artesunate. However, this can only be prescribed on a ‘named patient basis’. This means that although the medicine is licensed in some countries, it isn’t in the UK. However, your doctor may prescribe it for you if there is no alternative and the potential benefits are thought to outweigh the risks.
