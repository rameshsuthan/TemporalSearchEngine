Hepatitis B has an incubation period of about five to 22 weeks. The incubation period is the time from when you’re exposed to the virus to the start of your symptoms. However, some people have mild symptoms or don’t have any at all. These people are still infectious and can unknowingly pass on the disease to others.

If you do have symptoms, they may be similar to those of flu and include:

a mild fever
tiredness
aching limbs and/or joint pains
loss of appetite
feeling sick and vomiting
a reluctance to drink alcohol or smoke
You may also develop jaundice, which makes your skin and the whites of your eyes yellow. This is caused by a yellow-coloured substance in your blood called bilirubin. Bilirubin is usually broken down by your liver, but this doesn't happen if your liver is affected by hepatitis. Jaundice can also cause your urine to darken and your skin to itch.

These symptoms aren't always caused by hepatitis B but if you have them, see your GP.
