The various forms of typhus have abrupt onsets with typical incubation periods of 1 to 2 weeks. Epidemic typhus outbreaks typically occur where people are crowded together in unsanitary conditions (times of war, military camps, or natural disasters). Outbreaks are more prevalent in the winter months when blankets are shared and more clothing is worn. The disease is serious and can be fatal, particularly in the elderly.Endemic typhus is primarily an urban disease occurring in late summer to early autumn. Control of the rodent population and associated flea problems is essential in managing this disease.
