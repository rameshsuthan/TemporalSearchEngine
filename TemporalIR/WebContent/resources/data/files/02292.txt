Certain behaviours place a person at higher risk for getting infected with Ebola. Some examples are caring for an ill person, preparing the body of an Ebola patient for burial, and sharing a bed with an ill person. Other risky activities include attending the funeral of an Ebola patient, touching their bodily fluids, or handling or eating meat from a sick or dead animal. Healthcare professionals caring for Ebola patients face specific risks and must use proper personal protective equipment.
