Intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp)

Malaria infection during pregnancy is a major public health problem, with substantial risks for the mother, her fetus and the neonate. Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy is a full therapeutic course of antimalarial medicine given to pregnant women at routine prenatal visits, regardless of whether the recipient is infected with malaria. IPTp reduces maternal malaria episodes, maternal and fetal anaemia, placental parasitaemia, low birth weight, and neonatal mortality.

WHO recommends IPTp with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) in all areas with moderate to high malaria transmission in Africa. As of October 2012, WHO recommends that this preventive treatment be given to all pregnant women at each scheduled antenatal care visit except during the first trimester. WHO recommends a schedule of four antenatal care visits. Based on currently available evidence, the preventive efficacy of SP for IPTp persists even in areas where quintuple mutations linked to SP resistance are prevalent in P. falciparum.

Among the approximately 780 million persons at risk of malaria in endemic countries in sub-Saharan Africa, an estimated 32 million pregnant women could benefit from IPTp each year. However, during the last few years, WHO has observed a declining effort to scale-up IPTp in a number of African countries. In high-burden countries, IPTp noticeably lags behind other malaria control measures. This does not appear to be due to low levels of antenatal clinic attendance. Uncertainty among health workers about SP administration for IPTp may have also played a role. Simplified IPTp messages and health worker training have been shown to improve IPTp coverage.
