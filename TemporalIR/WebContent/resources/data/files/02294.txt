There is currently no cure for Ebola. An experimental medication called ZMapp was administered to two Ebola patients from the United States in early August. One of them seemed to dramatically improve after receiving it. Since then, it has been made available to a handful of infected healthcare workers who returned to Spain, the UK and a few people within Liberia. Any results from these isolated uses are anecdotal and cannot be considered conclusive evidence that the treatment works (or does not work). This medication has never been tested in humans and is highly experimental. It is not widely produced and it is not approved for human use. The supply is very likely already exhausted.
