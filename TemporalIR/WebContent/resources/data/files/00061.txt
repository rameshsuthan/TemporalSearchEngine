Dr. Piot had just graduated from medical school and was training to be a clinical microbiologist in 1976. While working in a lab at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium, Piot received a cheap plastic thermos containing two vials of blood and some melted ice. Also inside was a handwritten note from a Belgian doctor based in Zaire (presently the Democratic Republic of Congo). The note explained that the blood had been taken from a Belgian nun working in Zaire. She and two hundred others in a remote region of Zaire had become seriously sick with a mysterious illness. The thermos had been flown on a commercial flight from Zaire's capital city in one of the passenger's carry-on bags! Upon opening the thermos, Piot and his colleagues were greeted with a slushy mix of melted ice and blood. Of the two vials only one had remained intact while the other had shattered en route. This was later discovered to be the Ebola Virus existing in the lab in 1976. The mystery illness was Ebola.
