The fever and chills of malaria are associated with the rupture of erythrocytic-stage schizonts. In severe falciparum malaria, parasitized red cells may obstruct capillaries and postcapillary venules, leading to local hypoxia and the release of toxic cellular products. Obstruction of the microcirculation in the brain (cerebral malaria) and in other vital organs is thought to be responsible for severe complications. Cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor) are also felt to be involved, but at present their role is unclear.
