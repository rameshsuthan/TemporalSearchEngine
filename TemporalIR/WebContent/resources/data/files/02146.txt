County Public Health Officer Wilma Wooten said the local medical community has been alerted to be on the lookout for signs of the virus -- including fever, severe headache, muscle pain, weakness, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain and unexplained bleeding or bruising -- and to ask anyone with any of those symptoms about their recent travel history.
"While Ebola can be scary to people, the local risk for Ebola has not changed. We have a global community, and the possibility of someone traveling from Liberia, Guinea or Sierra Leone and flying back home here is much like the first case in Dallas," Wooten said."The good news is that we have a strong health care system that is more prepared than the countries in Africa where the outbreak is occurring, so any case in the U.S. is likely to be an isolated incident," she said.
