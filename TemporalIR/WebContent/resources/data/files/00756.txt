Contagious and incubation periods
Symptoms appear an average of 60 to 90 days after you have contact with the virus (incubation period). But they can appear as soon as 45 days to as late as 180 days after contact. Blood, semen, and vaginal fluids, whether fresh or dried, are highly contagious during this period and for several weeks after the start of symptoms.

If you have a short-term (acute) infection, in most cases you can't spread the virus after your body starts making a certain type of hepatitis B antibody. This generally takes several weeks. If you have a long-term (chronic) infection, you are able to spread the virus as long as you have an active infection.
