How will I know I have it?
The incubation period for murine typhus is 6 to 14 days. Symptoms of the
disease include headache, fever, nausea, and body aches. Five or six days
after the initial symptoms, you may get a rash that starts on the trunk of
your body and spreads to your arms and legs. If left untreated, the disease
may last for several months. A doctor can conduct tests to tell you if you
have murine typhus.
What do I do if I get murine typhus?
If you suspect that you have murine typhus, see a doctor as soon as
possible. If you wait too long to see a doctor, you may have to be
hospitalized. Murine typhus is easily treated with certain antibiotics. Once
you recover, you will not get it again.
