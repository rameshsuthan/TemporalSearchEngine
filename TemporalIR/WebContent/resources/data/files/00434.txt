Cholera infantum, or, as this form of disease is generally termed, "summer complaint," comprises all the various diseases of the digestive organs and brain with which children are attacked during the summer, and most frequently during dentition, during their second summer. The various forms of diseases of the digestive organs are those attacking the stomach as its principal seat, as catarrh, aridity, inflammation, ulceration, or softening of it, or the intestines alone are the seat of the disease, as an erythematous inflammation, catarrh, excoriations and ulceration.
