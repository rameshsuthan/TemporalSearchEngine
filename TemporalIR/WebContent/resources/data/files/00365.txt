Although HBV can survive outside the body for up to 1 week—and therefore, might be transmitted via indirect contact, such as from open sores—hepatitis B is spread predominantly parenterally, through intimate personal contact, and perinatally. Persons at risk include intravenous drug users, children of mothers with HBV, men who have sex with men, patients on hemodialysis, and those exposed to blood or blood products. The incubation period of HBV ranges from 45 to 160 days (mean, 100 days). The acute illness is usually mild, particularly in children. In adults, as many as 30% to 50% present with jaundice, and hepatitis may be fulminant in 0.1% to 0.5% of those with acute hepatitis B infection. Symptoms therefore range widely in severity, from asymptomatic subclinical infection to fulminant fatal disease. An insidious onset of nausea, anorexia, malaise, and fatigue, or flulike symptoms, such as pharyngitis, cough, coryza, photophobia, headache, and myalgias, can precede the onset of jaundice. Fever is uncommon, unlike with hepatitis A infection. These symptoms abate with the onset of jaundice, although anorexia, malaise, and weakness can persist. Physical examination features are nonspecific but can include mild enlargement and slight tenderness of the liver, mild splenomegaly, and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy in 15% to 20% of patients. Fulminant disease (acute liver failure) manifests with a change in mental status (encephalopathy) and coagulopathy.5
