Who Received This Treatment: Thomas Eric Duncan, the first man diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S., took the drug Brincidofovir  but died a few weeks after contracting the Ebola virus. NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo is also taking the drug, and his condition is improving, reported Nebraska Medicine nursing director Shelly Schwedhelm.
