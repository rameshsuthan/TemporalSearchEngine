Dr. Kent Brantly is congratulated by Emory University Hospital nurses and staff as he is discharged in August after receiving treatment for Ebola. When the first Ebola patient to be treated in the United States was headed for Emory University Hospital this past summer, two of the hospital’s nurses canceled their vacations to be there. That’s how registered nurse Barbara Ribner described the dedication of the Emory nurses who deal with Ebola Virus. Her husband, Dr. Bruce Ribner, is the medical director of the Serious Communicable Diseases Unit, which has successfully cared for four patients with Ebola.
