The number of new cases of ebola in Sierra Leone was above 600 in each of the three weeks leading up to Nov. 25, the most in any three-week period so far. International health officials have had particular difficulty combating the disease in this country. In October, they conceded that they were overwhelmed and approved plans to help families tend to patients at home until more hospital beds became available.
