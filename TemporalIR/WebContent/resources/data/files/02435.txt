So how did the 2-year-old get the virus? "We suppose that the first case was infected following contact with bats," Sylvain Baize at France's Pasteur Institute, and one of the researchers studying the outbreak, tells The New York Times. "Maybe, but we are not sure." The blood of fruit bats, as well as monkeys and apes, can infect people, but some researchers think that fruit with bat guano on it can also spread the virus to humans.
