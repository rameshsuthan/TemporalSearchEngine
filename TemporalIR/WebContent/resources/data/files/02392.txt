The North Dallas hospital, considered one of the best in Texas, has come under criticism since the arrival Sept. 25 of Thomas Eric Duncan – the first patient in the U.S. diagnosed with Ebola.The diagnostic team that treated Duncan — who had symptoms of headache, abdominal pain and fever consistent with the Ebola virus — did not know he told a receiving nurse that he had traveled from Africa. On that day, Duncan was sent home with antibiotics. He returned to the hospital by ambulance two days later.
