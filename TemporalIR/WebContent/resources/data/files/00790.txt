Incubation period

The time between an infectious mosquito bite and the first detection of parasites in a blood smear is generally 6–16 days. Symptoms may not occur at that time and the first presentation of the infection may be delayed for weeks or months. Commonly, clinical symptoms occur after 7–14 days for P. falciparum, 7–30 days for P. malariae and 8–14 days for P. vivax and P. ovale.

Suboptimal suppression with prophylactic drugs may delay the clinical presentation and transmission by blood transfusion usually results in a shorter incubation period.
