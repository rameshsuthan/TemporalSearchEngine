A Spanish priest infected with the Ebola virus in Liberia has arrived in Madrid for treatment.
The heavy security measures suggest Spain is taking the deadly disease very seriously.
75-year-old Miguel Pajares had been working as a missionary in the west African state when he tested positive for Ebola at a hospital in Monroviaon on the 10th of August. A nun who is also a Spanish national from Equatorial Guinea will also be repatriated. She has not tested positive but has been exposed to the Ebola virus.
