The first two Americans to develop Ebola, Dr. Kent Brantly and nurse Nancy Writebol, were infected in West Africa and were flown back to the U.S. to also be treated at Emory. Brantly, who is 33, was released from the hospital about a month after he developed symptoms, and Writebol, age 59, was released about five weeks after she developed symptoms.
