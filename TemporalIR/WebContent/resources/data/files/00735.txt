How to prevent CHOLERA
Cholera can be prevented through careful sanitation, careful use and treatment
of water before drinking or cooking, and careful handling of food. 
SANITATION
WATER FOOD
In an emergency, while a more permanent latrine is
being built, a simple pit can be dug as a temporary
solution for the disposal of human excreta. It should
measure 0.3 x 0.3 meter, have a depth of
0.5 meters, and be at least 30 meters from a
well or other source of drinking
water. Where possible, the pit
should be at least 6 meters
from the nearest house. 
It should not be located uphill from the water source
or dug in marshy soil. The bottom of the pit should
never penetrate the groundwater table. After each use,
a layer of soil should be laid down in the pit. In an area
affected by cholera, the pit should also be coated
each day with a layer of unslaked lime. For
more information about other latrine
designs, please see Sanitation and
Cleanliness for a Healthy Environment.
