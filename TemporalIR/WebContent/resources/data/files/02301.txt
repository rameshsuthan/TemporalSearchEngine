The Centers for Disease Control chronology notes this infection as "Sudan virus", whereas the 1977 British Medical Journal (BMJ) article refers to it as "Ebola virus". In 1977, there was not yet a distinction between different ebolaviruses. The BMJ article only notes that the patient received "convalescent serum from the Sudan" following similar serum from Zaire.
