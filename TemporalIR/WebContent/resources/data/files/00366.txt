Laboratory diagnosis (Table 1)
Hepatitis B virus first appears in the blood during the incubation period, while the virus is actively `replicating' in liver cells. The antigen is produced in vast excess so that it is not only associated with new infectious virus particles, but also occurs in the serum as small non-infectious spherical and filamentous forms. In acute infection, the Hepatitis B virus usually disappears within 3 months of onset. The Hepatitis B virus and HBV DNA can also be detected in blood while the virus is actively replicating in the liver (Fig. 2). Symptoms usually appear as the concentrations of bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase and each of the major viral components peak in the serum. These events coincide with the first appearance of antibodies to HBV proteins (Fig. 2).
