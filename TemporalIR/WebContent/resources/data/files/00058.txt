This family of viruses was discovered in 1967, when an outbreak occurred in Marburg, Germany. This particular filovirus (now called Marburg virus) was transmitted to lab workers by infected monkeys imported from Uganda. The only recorded cases of Marburg since the German outbreak were found in Kenya and Zimbabwe.
