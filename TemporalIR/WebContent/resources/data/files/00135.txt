The primary symptoms of cholera are profuse diarrhea and vomiting of clear fluid.[11] These symptoms usually start suddenly, half a day to five days after ingestion of the bacteria.[12] The diarrhea is frequently described as "rice water" in nature and may have a fishy odor.[11] An untreated person with cholera may produce 10 to 20 litres (3 to 5 US gal) of diarrhea a day.[11] Severe cholera, without treatment, kills about half of affected individuals.[11] If the severe diarrhea is not treated, it can result in life-threatening dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.[11] Estimates of the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infections have ranged from 3 to 100.[13] Cholera has been nicknamed the "blue death" because a person's skin may turn bluish-gray from extreme loss of fluids.[14]
Historical descriptions of cholera are found as early as the 5th century BC.
