Coagulation defects — The coagulation defects seen in Ebola virus disease appear to be induced indirectly, through the host inflammatory response. Virus-infected macrophages synthesize cell-surface tissue factor (TF), triggering the extrinsic coagulation pathway; proinflammatory cytokines also induce macrophages to produce TF [104]. The simultaneous occurrence of these two stimuli helps to explain the rapid development and severity of the coagulopathy in Ebola virus infection. Subsequent sequencing analyses from cases in Guinea and Sierra Leone indicate that the virus emerged in December 2013, likely from a single zoonotic introduction in a young child in Guéckédou, Guinea. 
From that first case of Ebola virus disease, the virus has spread to five countries (Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria, and Senegal), causing 4293 suspected and confirmed cases and claiming 2296 lives (as of September 6, 2014). Prior to 2014, the largest outbreak of Ebola virus disease on record, caused by Sudan ebolavirus, resulted in 425 cases and 224 deaths in Uganda.
