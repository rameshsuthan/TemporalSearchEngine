Today (Oct. 28), nurse Amber Vinson, who was infected with Ebola earlier this month, was declared free of the virus, and was released from Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, where she was treated. Vinson's release comes less than a week after Nina Pham, a nurse who works with Vinson and was also infected with Ebola, was declared free of the virus and well enough to go home.
