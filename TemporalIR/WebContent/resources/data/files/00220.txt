But while the Americans were finishing the Tubmanburg Ebola center, their first in Liberia, the national caseload suddenly began to decline. By the time the treatment unit opened in November, the country was down to fewer than 100 cases per week, from a peak of more than 300. By December, the number had dropped to fewer than 30 cases per week. Workers at an Ebola treatment center now relax on Jan. 10, 2015 in Tubmanburg, Liberia. The facility was built by the U.S. military.
