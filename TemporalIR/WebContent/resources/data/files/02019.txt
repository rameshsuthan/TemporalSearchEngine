Thomas Eric Duncan was from Monrovia, Liberia, to date the country which has been hit hardest by the Ebola virus epidemic. Duncan worked as a personal driver for the general manager of Safeway Cargo, a FedEx contractor in Liberia. According to manager Henry Brunson, Duncan had abruptly quit his job on September 4, 2014, giving no reason. Brunson added he knew Duncan had family in the United States and that Duncan's sister had come from the U.S. to visit him in the weeks before he quit. Duncan received a visa to make his first trip to the U.S where he would later reunite with his estranged teenage son and the boy's mother, Louise Troh, who had been his girlfriend in Liberia.
