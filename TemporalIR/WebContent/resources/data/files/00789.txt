Aetiology[7]
Malaria is a parasitic disease caused by infection by species of the genus Plasmodium:

 	Clinical features	UK cases 2011[8] 
Plasmodium falciparum	Responsible for severe disease and malaria-related deaths.
Incubation 7-14 days (up to 1 year if semi-immune); most travellers present within 8 weeks.
Classical tertian and subtertian periodicity
(paroxysms at 48- and 36-hour intervals) are rare;
daily (quotidian) or irregular are more common.	1,149
Plasmodium vivax	Causes benign tertian malaria - fever every third day.
Incubation period of 12-17 days.
Relapse due to dormant parasites in the liver.	416
Plasmodium ovale	Relapsing course as with P. vivax.
Incubation period of 15-18 days.	77
Plasmodium malariae	Causes benign quartan malaria - fever every 4th day,
but this is frequently not observed, particularly in early infection.
Long incubation period (18-40 days).
Parasites can remain dormant in the blood. 5-10% present over a year after infection. With chronic infection, can cause nephrotic syndrome.
