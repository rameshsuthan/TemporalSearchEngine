Ebola Incubation Period
Ebola Viral Disease is a potentially fatal infection which kills at least a half of anyone it infects. The ebola incubation period lasts between 2 and 21 days, after which some pretty severe symptoms will be experienced. The search for a cure still continues.
The dreaded Ebola viral disease, previously named Ebola hemorrhagic fever is a serious disease which kills up to 90% of anyone it infects. So far, the virus can be contracted by humans, as well as nonhuman primates which include such animals as chimpanzees, gorillas and monkeys.

The virus made its first appearance in 1976 with outbreaks in a village close to the Ebola River located in the Democratic Republic of Congo and a secluded area in the Sudan, simultaneously.

Although its origin remains unknown, it is the firm belief of researchers that the main hosts of the Ebola virus are fruit bats or Pteropodidae.
