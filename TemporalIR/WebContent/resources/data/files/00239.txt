A surgeon from Sierra Leone, who is critically ill with Ebola, has arrived in the US for treatment. Martin Salia, who has US residency and is married to an American, has been taken to a hospital in Nebraska. Meanwhile France has advised its citizens not to travel to parts of Mali, following the deaths of three people there from the disease. Dr Salia is the 10th person treated for Ebola Virus in the US. All but one - a Liberian man named Thomas Eric Duncan - have recovered.
