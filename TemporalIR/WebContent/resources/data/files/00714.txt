Malaria is a serious disease, which in the worst case may be fatal. It's widespread in tropical and subtropical areas.
From a global viewpoint, malaria constitutes an enormous health problem, with an estimated 200 million plus new cases a year.
In the UK in 2012, 1378 people returned with the disease (72 per cent falciparum), with two deaths. Many of those infected did not take malaria prophylaxis and many are people visiting friends and relatives in their countries of origin.
Prevention requires A, B, C and D.
Awareness of risk.
Bite avoidance.
Chemoprophylaxis (taking preventive medicines if you are travelling to or living in a malaria region).
Diagnosis made promptly with early treatment of an infected case.
