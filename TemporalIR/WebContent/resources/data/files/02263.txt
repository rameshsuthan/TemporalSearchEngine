Governors appear to be working out the details of these policies on the fly. New Jersey was forced to clarify its rule after a Doctors Without Borders nurse Kaci Hickox went public, even hiring legal aid for what she said was a human rights violation. Instead of confining health workers to a hospital isolation unit, as Kickox was, asymptomatic people who've had direct contact with Ebola will be transported by private vehicles to their homes. For a period of 21 days, they will have "at least two unannounced visits by local officials" to check in.
