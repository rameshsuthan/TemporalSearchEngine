Typically, the time between being infected and when symptoms start (incubation period) is seven to 18 days, depending on the specific parasite you are infected with. However, in some cases it can take up to a year for symptoms to develop.
The initial symptoms of malaria are flu-like and include a high temperature (fever), headache, sweats, chills and vomiting. These symptoms are often mild and can sometimes be difficult to identify as malaria.
