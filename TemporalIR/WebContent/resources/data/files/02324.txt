The first symptoms of Ebola are a sudden increase in body temperature, accompanied by strong headaches, joint and muscle pain. Decreased appetite and sore throat are also early indicators of the disease.One of the first tissues the virus settles in is collagen. Collagen keeps the body’s organs in place, like an organic glue. Ebola eats away at collagen, causing all kinds of problems. The patient’s upper layer of skin ends up floating on a layer of liquefied tissue, resulting in tiny white blisters and red spots on the surface that can tear off with just a small amount of pressure. Rips in the skin can appear and spontaneous bleeding can occur from several orifices, including the eyes, nose and mouth.
