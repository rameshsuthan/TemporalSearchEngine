There is currently an outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease occurring in West Africa. It was first reported in March 2014 in Guinea and since late May has now spread to involve four countries: Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria (so far all the cases in Nigeria have been linked to transmission from a single imported case; there is no evidence of wider transmission in that country).
