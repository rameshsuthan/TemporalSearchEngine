Laboratory studies of choice are serologic tests for antibodies. The main confirmatory tests are the indirect immunoperoxidase test and the immunofluorescent assay.[46] An infection is confirmed by a 4-fold increase in antibody titers between acute and convalescent serum specimens. A single high titer with classic clinical features is considered a probable case. Serology for all suspected subtypes should be requested.[6]
