Individuals with typhus may indicate a history of crowded living conditions or relocation to refugee camps because of natural disaster or war. They may also report flea bite. Individuals often report severe headache, nonproductive cough, nausea, muscle aches (myalgia), chest pain, and a general feeling of illness (malaise). These are followed by a sudden onset of chills, high fever, and extreme fatigue (prostration) that may progress to delirium and stupor. At around 4 to 7 days, a rash may appear on the trunk that spreads across most of the body, but rarely involves the face, palms, and soles.
