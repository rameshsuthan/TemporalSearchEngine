Kobinger�s research provides reassurance. In a study published in Science, Kobinger compared animals with IgG levels � blood borne immune system triggers � of the antibody produced against potentially lethal inoculations of Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV). The findings confirm that this specific antibody can offer immunity. As a rule of thumb with other diseases, the antibodies Kobinger found provide correlates of protection, or expected immunity � with up to 99 percent accuracy. Not only can scientists now predict immunity but they can also confirm a vaccinated person will become immune, which is a step towards human trials - See more at: http://www.healthmap.org/site/diseasedaily/article/human-trials-ebola-vaccine-11812#sthash.gLipxuzI.dpuf
