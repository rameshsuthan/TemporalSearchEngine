Etiology
Cholera results from infection by Vibrio cholerae, a Gram negative, facultatively anaerobic rod in the family Vibrionaceae. Two serogroups, 01 and 0139 (“Bengal”), can cause disease. Serogroup O1 contains two serologically indistinguishable biotypes, classical and El Tor. Mild or asymptomatic infections are seen more often with the El Tor biotype. Cholera caused by serogroup 0139 emerged in 1992, in epidemics in India and Bangladesh.
Incubation Period
The incubation period is a few hours to 5 days. Most infections become apparent after 2 to 3 days.
