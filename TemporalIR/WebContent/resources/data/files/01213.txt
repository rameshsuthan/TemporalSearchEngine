Diagnosis of malaria involves performing blood smears. For a blood smear, a drop of blood is applied to and spread onto a glass slide. It is then treated with a special stain and examined under a microscope. Typically, two thick smears and two thin smears are prepared. These tests are currently the "gold standard" for malaria detection and identification. They require examination by a trained and experienced laboratorian.
