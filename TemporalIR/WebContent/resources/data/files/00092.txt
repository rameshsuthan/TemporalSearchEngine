The first study involved two US physicians who were evacuated from the outbreak region after they were infected with Ebola. Rick Sacra, MD, was flown to the high-biocontainment unit at Nebraska Medical Center in Sep 5 after he was infected in Liberia, and Ian Crozier, MD, was admitted to Emory University Hospital's special communicable disease unit on Sep 9 after he was infected in Sierra Leone. Sacra is a family medicine physician from the University of Massachusetts Medical School who was working for the missionary group SIM USA, and Crozier is an infectious disease specialist from Vanderbilt University who was working for the World Health Organization (WHO). Both patients received aggressive supportive care, and their clinicians got clearance and patient consent to use two experimental treatments: TKM-Ebola, a short-strand RNA (siRNA) drug cocktail developed by Tekmira Pharmaceuticals, and convalescent serum.
