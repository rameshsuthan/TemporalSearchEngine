Suggestions for prevention of typhus include: maintaining personal hygiene (helps guard against lice carrying the disease) controlling the rodent population (rodents are known to carry arthropods) avoiding places where exposure has occurred (typhus has been responsible for epidemics and outbreaks) chemoprophylaxis with doxycycline (used as a preventative only in those at high risk, such as those on humanitarian campaigns in areas with extreme poverty and little or no sanitation). Immunization and louse control are highly effective for prevention of typhus. However, vaccines are not available in the US. Lice may be eliminated by dusting infested people with malathion or lindane.
