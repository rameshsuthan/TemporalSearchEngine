INCUBATION PERIOD

Following the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito, the inoculated sporozoites go to the liver within one to two hours. Individuals are asymptomatic for 12 to 35 days (depending on parasite species), until the erythrocytic stage of the parasite life cycle (figure 1). Release of merozoites from infected red cells when they rupture causes fever and the other manifestations of malaria.

The incubation period for P. falciparum infection is about 12 to 14 days; most infections due to P. falciparum become clinically apparent within one month after exposure [3]. Longer incubation periods are more likely in semi-immune individuals and individuals taking ineffective malaria prophylaxis.
