After the virus enters the body, there is an incubation period lasting 1.5 to 6 months (average 4 months) until illness begins.  During the acute phase (first 6 months after infection) most persons have no symptoms or might experience a mild illness. Symptoms of acute HBV infection, when present, may include:
•	Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)
•	Dark-colored urine, light-colored stools
•	Fatigue
•	Abdominal pain
•	Loss of appetite
•	Nausea
•	Diarrhea
•	Fever
During the chronic phase (> 6 months after infection) hepatitis B usually progresses silently, with no symptoms at all during the first 10-20 years. Signs of severe liver scarring (cirrhosis) may include:
      •	Ascites (accumulation of fluid and swelling of the abdominal cavity)
•	Star-shaped vein pattern developing on the swollen belly
•	Jaundice
•	Itching
•	Easy bruising and bleeding
