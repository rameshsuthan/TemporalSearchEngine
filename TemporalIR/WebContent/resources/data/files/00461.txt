When you're bitten by a malaria-infected mosquito, the parasites that cause malaria are released into your blood and infect your liver cells. After the early stages, life-threatening complications may develop rapidly with P. falciparum and P. knowlesi. If the infected person is not treated, serious complications or death can occur. But you may recover in a week to a month (or longer) after being infected with P. vivax, P. malariae, or P. ovale, even without treatment
