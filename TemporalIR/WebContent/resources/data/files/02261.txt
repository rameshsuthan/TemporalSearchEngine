In the context of Ebola, a quarantine would involve separating a healthy person who had contact with Ebola patients (e.g. health-care workers returning to the US from West Africa) from others for 21 days. Again, this is different from isolating people who have tested positive for Ebola in, say, a special unit at a hospital.
