Doctors Without Borders helped identify and treat the outbreak in March, and health officials thought they had it contained by April. The Ebola outbreak flared up a month later, worse than ever — there are now officially 1,779 cases, including 961 deaths, but health authorities believe there are more cases. The World Health Organization has declared an international health emergency.
