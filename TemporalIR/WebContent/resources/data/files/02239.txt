The Department of Homeland Security estimated that around 8,000 people from the three West African countries most affected by Ebola would now be able to apply for work permits, as well as immunity from deportation. These protections, which apply only to people already in the U.S. as of today, will last for 18 months, at which point officials will re-assess based on the state of the epidemic.
