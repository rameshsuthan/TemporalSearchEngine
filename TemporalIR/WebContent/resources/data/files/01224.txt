Indications for Testing
Febrile illness in setting of unhygienic environments
Laboratory Testing
Clinical presentation and diagnosis recommendations (CDC)
Nonspecific
CBC
Hepatic transaminases
Bilirubin
Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)
IgG and IgM by IFA – method of confirming diagnosis
Convalescent specimen usually required
IgG does not differentiate between primary infection and Brill-Zinsser disease
Febrile antibody testing
More specific than Weil-Felix but still has cross-reactivity with Brucella and Salmonella
Must be used in conjunction with clinical presentation
Weil-Felix – not sensitive or specific; outmoded; should not be used
Culture – not routinely available because of biosafety issues (research labs only)
