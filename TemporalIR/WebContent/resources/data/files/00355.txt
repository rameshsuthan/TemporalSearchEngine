Ebola Virus Incubation Period
Incubation Period
The period of incubation for the Ebola viral disease is usually between 5 and 10 days. However, this period can be extended to 2 to 21 days in total. The Ebola viral disease carries great risk of death for anyone who becomes infected. Following a period of incubation of between 2 and 21 days, the virus will then cause the infected individual to display a range and variety of symptoms. These often include intense pain, diarrhea, nausea, feeling ill and at times, internal and external bleeding. Within the second week of infection the fever will either lessen or the patient will begin to experience multiple organ failure. There is a relatively high mortality rate ranging from between 50% to 90%. This depends on the species and strain of the virus. Infected persons usually die from either organ failure or hypovolemic shock.
