Twenty-one days has been regarded as the appropriate quarantine period for holding individuals potentially exposed to Ebola Virus to reduce risk of contagion, but there does not appear to be a systemic discussion of the basis for this period," lead researcher Charles Haas, an environmental engineering professor at Drexel University, wrote in the study paper.

In the study, published in the Oct. 14 issue of the journal PLOS: Outbreak, Haas speculates that official health authorities such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have based the current incubation period on transmission rates in Zaire, in 1976, and Uganda, in 2000. In these countries, the maximum incubation period was 21 days based on available data, the study reveals.

Twenty-one days is the standard time that health authorities currently use to monitor a person who may have been exposed to Ebola but is not exhibiting symptoms.

“I got curious where the 21-day figure was coming from,” Haas told FoxNews.com. “I started to look at the literature, and thought that it would shed light on it, and I came up with the previous outbreak studies.”
