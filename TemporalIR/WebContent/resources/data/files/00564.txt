The first case of Ebola has been confirmed in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, after a Dallas patient visited Liberia – the West African country which is experiencing one of the worst outbreaks of the disease in history.
The patient, who was in the U.S. to visit family, was admitted by the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas on Sept. 28 after developing symptoms of the virus, including fever, and was immediately placed in isolation, said CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden in a press conference Tuesday.
The patient didn’t have any symptoms of the disease while on the plane, and only someone who is sick and suffering its effects can spread Ebola, said Dr. Frieden, as it is not an airborne disease.
At least four American medical missionaries became infected and fell ill in Africa while treating Ebola patients. All were flown back to the U.S. in isolation and have recovered.
