Acute Hepatitis B
About two-thirds of patients with acute HBV infection have a mild, asymptomatic and subclinical illness that usually goes undetected.30 Approximately one-third of adults with acute HBV infection develop clinical symptoms and signs of hepatitis, which range fom mild constitutional symptoms of fatigue and nausea, to more marked symptoms and jaundice, and rarely to acute liver failure. The clinical incubation period of acute hepatitis B averages 2–3 months and can range from 1–6 months after exposure, the length of the incubation period correlating, to some extent, with the level of virus exposure.31 The incubation period is followed by a short preicteric or prodromal period of constitutional symptoms such as fever, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, and body aches. During this phase, serum ALT levels rise and high levels of HBsAg and HBV DNA are detectable. The preicteric phase lasts a few days to as long as a week and is followed by onset of jaundice or dark urine. The icteric phase of hepatitis B lasts for a variable period averaging 1–2 weeks, during which viral levels decrease. In convalescence, jaundice resolves but constitutional symptoms may last for weeks or even months. During this phase, HBsAg is cleared followed by the disappearance of detectable HBV DNA from serum.

Acute liver failure occurs in approximately 1% of patients with acute hepatitis B and jaundice.32 The onset of fulminant hepatitis is typically marked by the sudden appearance of fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, and jaundice, followed by disorientation, confusion, and coma. HBsAg and HBV DNA levels generally fall rapidly as liver failure develops, and some patients are HBsAg-negative by the time of onset of hepatic coma. Patients with acute liver failure due to hepatitis B require careful management and monitoring and should be referred rapidly to a tertiary medical center with the availability of liver transplantation.33
