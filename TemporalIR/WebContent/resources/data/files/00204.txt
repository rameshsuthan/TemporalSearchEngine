Of the nine people treated for Ebola in the U.S. so far, only one case has proven fatal. Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian man infected before he arrived in the U.S., died at a Dallas hospital on Oct. 8. In New York City, Dr. Craig Spencer is currently reported to be in serious but stable condition after being hospitalized last week. The other patients -- mostly health care workers who contracted Ebola Virus while caring for others -- have all recovered.
