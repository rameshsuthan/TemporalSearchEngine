A test called an RT-PCR, for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, detects bits of the RNA of the virus itself, so it can be used much earlier in the infection. In some cases, a very sensitive PCR test may detect the virus two days before fever and other symptoms appear. But there is no way to know which people will develop enough virus in their blood to detect soon after they are infected, and which will take many more days.
