The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses currently recognizes five ebolaviruses: Ebola virus (EBOV), Sudan virus (SUDV), Reston virus (RESTV), Taï Forest virus (TAFV), and Bundibugyo virus (BDBV). Four of these viruses are known to cause Ebola virus disease (EVD) in humans, and the fifth, RESTV, has caused EVD in other primates.
