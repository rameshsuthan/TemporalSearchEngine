Filoviruses cause a sudden onset of symptoms such as: fever, chills, anorexia, sore throat, vomiting, diarrhea, and in the case of hemorrhagic illness; bleeding from internal organs. 
While there is no vaccine or treatment specific to filoviruses, general treatment methods include maintaining blood and electrolyte levels and rehydration. Health care workers are advised by the WHO to keep infected patients isolated and to use barrier nursing conditions (wearing protective layers, such as masks and gloves) and not to re-use non-disposable items until they have been properly disinfected.
