Hepatitis B Incubation Period
The period between transmission of the hepatitis B virus and the beginning of symptoms of hepatitis B -- which is known as the "hepatitis B incubation period" -- lasts between 30 and 180 days. The length of this incubation period will depend on how many virus particles a person has been exposed to. Infection with very few particles causes a longer incubation period. A person is contagious during the hepatitis B incubation period, and may remain contagious for up to 15 weeks after hepatitis B symptoms begin.
