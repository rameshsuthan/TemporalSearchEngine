It is likely that typhus existed in ancient history, although the first clear historical description of typhus comes from the eleventh century, when an outbreak took place in a monastery in Sicily. Typhus reached epidemic proportions in 1489, during a siege in Granada. Typhus then spread throughout Europe.Typhus also was present in the Americas, although there is some controversy as to whether Spanish explorers brought the disease in the sixteenth century, or whether the disease already was present in Aztec and other pre-Columbian societies.In the early nineteenth century, typhus increased dramatically in Europe. In the twentieth century, typhus spread through Europe, North Africa, and the Pacific Islands, killing thousands of prisoners in German concentration camps.
