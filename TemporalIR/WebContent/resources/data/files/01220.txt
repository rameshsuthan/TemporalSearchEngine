Confirmation or exclusion of a diagnosis of malaria depends upon laboratory examination of a blood sample. The standard test involves microscopic examination of thick and thin blood smears. Accurate blood smear examination requires considerable training and experience, particularly in the interpretation of the thick smear and in the speciation of identified parasites. Lack of experienced personnel may limit the accuracy of malaria diagnosis in laboratories in Canada(147), while diagnosis in low-income countries is often unreliable because of problems with the quality of the microscope or the stains, and supervision and quality control of the laboratory(148). For example, among Peace Corps volunteers whose malaria was diagnosed by blood smear in local clinics in Africa, the diagnosis could be confirmed in only 25% of cases(112).
