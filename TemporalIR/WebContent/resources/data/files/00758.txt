What are the symptoms of hepatitis B?
The incubation period, from the time of exposure to the virus until the onset of the disease, is two to six months. Early symptoms include poor appetite, nausea, aching muscles and joints and sometimes mild fever.
Later symptoms include yellowing of the skin, mucous membranes, and whites of the eyes (jaundice, icterus); light-coloured stools; and dark urine.
When the late symptoms have developed, the patient usually begins to get better.
In approximately 1 out of 20 infected adults, the infection becomes chronic or ongoing. Patients with chronic hepatitis B generally have no symptoms unless they develop liver damage.
Approximately one fifth of those with chronic infection develop scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) over a number of years which may result in liver failure and risks of liver cancer.
On average, cirrhosis develops decades after infection. Infected newborn babies may show no symptoms of acute hepatitis but unless given appropriate immunisation have high (more than 90 per cent) risks of chronic infection
