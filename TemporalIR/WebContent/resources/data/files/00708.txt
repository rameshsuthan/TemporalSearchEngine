Preventing Ebola
Individuals can take several precautions to protect against Ebola. These steps include:

avoiding contact with blood and body fluids
educating themselves on recognizing the disease and preventing it
practicing careful hand hygiene, including washing hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer
refraining from engaging in burial rituals that involve handling the body of a person who died from Ebola
refraining from handling items a person with Ebola has handled, including clothing, bedding, needles, or medical equipment
Healthcare workers and lab technicians also must practice very careful precautions. This includes isolating people with Ebola and wearing protective gowns, gloves, masks, and eye shields when coming in contact with the infected person or their belongings. Careful protocol and disposal of these protective materials is also vital for infection prevention.

Cleaning crews should use a bleach solution to clean floors and surfaces that may have come in contact with the Ebola virus.
