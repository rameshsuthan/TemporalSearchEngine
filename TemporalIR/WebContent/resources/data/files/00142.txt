The biggest challenge in controlling any epidemic is separating those infected from those that are not. This breaks the cycle of transmission. In the case of Ebola, this is especially difficult. First, the symptoms of Ebola are not specific. Fever, weakness, and headaches could be anything from the flu to malaria. But once a person has symptoms, they are infectious to others. So putting a malaria patient next to an Ebola patient while waiting for a diagnosis is a bad idea and can accelerate transmission. The second challenge is that blood samples are generally required to make the diagnosis. Blood is highly infectious, and drawing blood samples can put health workers in danger. Careless infections and deaths among the short supply of health workers has been happening far too often.
