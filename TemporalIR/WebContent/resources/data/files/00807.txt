Yellow fever is a potentially fatal viral infection spread by mosquitoes. A vaccine for yellow fever must be provided by approved yellow fever vaccination clinics. These clinics provide a vaccinations certificate in a form that is approved by the World Health Organization.

Yellow fever is not found in Australia, but some countries require proof of vaccination against Yellow Fever before you are allowed to enter.

For some countries yellow fever is a very serious risk and may vaccinate you when you arrive, refuse you entry, or put you in a quarantine facility if you are not vaccinated against yellow fever.

If you are travelling to a Yellow Fever country you should contact the diplomatic missions of ALL of the countries you intend to visit to check their requirements for Yellow Fever vaccination and discuss these requirements with your doctor or a specialist travel clinic before you leave. The public health unit in your state or territory can assist you in locating your closest accredited vaccination centre.

If you are returning to Australia from a country where Yellow Fever occurs you are required to present a yellow fever vaccination certificate. You may enter Australia without a vaccination certificate, however upon arrival Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Biosecurity officers will reinforce the seriousness of the disease and provide you with a Yellow Fever Action Card. This card provides instructions on what an unvaccinated person should do if they develop any symptoms of yellow fever in the six-day period following their departure from a yellow fever declared place.
