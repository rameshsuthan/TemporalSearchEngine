Malaria (Group B disease) must be notified in writing within five days of diagnosis.
School exclusion is not required.
Infectious agent
Malaria is caused by parasites of the Plasmodium spp. Four species of Plasmodium (P.) can infect humans: P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae and P. falciparum. Infection is most commonly caused by P. vivax or P. falciparum, the latter causing the most severe form of malaria. Mixed infections may occur.
Incubation period
The time between an infectious mosquito bite and the first detection of parasites in a blood smear is generally 6–16 days. Symptoms may not occur at that time and the first presentation of the infection may be delayed for weeks or months. Commonly, clinical symptoms occur after 7–14 days for P. falciparum, 7–30 days for P. malariae and 8–14 days for P. vivax and P. ovale.
Suboptimal suppression with prophylactic drugs may delay the clinical presentation and transmission by blood transfusion usually results in a shorter incubation period.
