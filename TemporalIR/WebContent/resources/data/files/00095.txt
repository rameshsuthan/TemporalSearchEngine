SiRNA treatment cures Ebola in monkeys
The first laboratory trial demonstrating the effectiveness of an experimental drug against the strain of Ebola currently ravaging West Africa has been performed in rhesus monkeys. The treatment is a modified version of a drug developed against an earlier strain of Ebola. The researchers say that, as the modifications necessary to alter the drug are relatively straightforward, the treatment could be adapted quickly for use against future strains of the virus. Thomas Geisbert of the University of Texas, US, and colleagues adapted a treatment they had previously developed to treat the Kikwit strain to target the Makona strain. The treatment is a short interfering RNA (siRNA), which binds to a segment of the virus's messenger RNA and prevents it being transcribed into a protein, thereby preventing a viable virus from being formed.

Once the genome of the new virus had been sequenced, the researchers altered the base-pair sequence of their siRNA and produce several hundred doses of a new siRNA within 8 weeks. They tested the treatment on six infected rhesus monkeys: three that received the treatment after 72 hours survived, whereas those that did not became so ill they had to be euthanized. The treatment is now being tested in patients in Sierra Leone, and Geisbert says that the ability to make small changes quickly could be useful for future outbreaks.
