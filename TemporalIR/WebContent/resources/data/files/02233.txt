So far, nine people have received treatment for the disease in American hospitals. Seven have fully recovered. One, Craig Spencer, is undergoing treatment at Bellevue Hospital in New York City. The one patient who died was Duncan and we have a pretty good idea of why that happened. Physicians misdiagnosed his ailment when he first showed up with symptoms. It was only upon his return to the hospital, several days later, they recognized a case of Ebola—and, by then, the disease had progressed. He didn’t simply have a fever. He was vomiting and had diarrhea.
