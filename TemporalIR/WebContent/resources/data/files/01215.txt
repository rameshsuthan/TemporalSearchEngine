Early and accurate diagnosis of malaria is essential for effective disease management and malaria surveillance. High-quality malaria diagnosis is important in all settings as misdiagnosis can result in significant morbidity and mortality. WHO recommends prompt malaria diagnosis either by microscopy or malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) in all patients with suspected malaria before treatment is administered. Diagnostic testing improves the management of all patients with febrile illnesses, and may also help to reduce the emergence and spread of drug resistance by reserving antimalarials for those who actually have the disease.
