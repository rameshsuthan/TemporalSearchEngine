In endemic areas, diagnosis is generally made on clinical grounds alone. However, overshadowing of the diagnosis is quite often as the clinical symptoms overlap with other infectious diseases like Dengue Fever, Paratyphoid, and pyrexia of unknown origin (P.U.O). If the eschar can be identified it is quite diagnostic of Scrub typhus, but this is very unreliable in the native population whom have dark skin, and moreover, the site of eschar which is usually where the mite bites is often located in covered areas. Unless it is actively searched it is most likely that eschar would be missed. History of mite bite is often absent since the bite does not inflict pain and the mites are almost microscopic to be seen by a naked eye. Usually Scrub typhus is often labelled as P.U.O in remote endemic areas since blood culture is often negative, yet it can be treated effectively with chloramphenicol. Where there is doubt, the diagnosis may be confirmed by a laboratory test such as serology. Again, this is often unavailable in most endemic areas since the serological test involved is not included in the routine screening tests for P.U.O. especially in Burma or Myanmar. It may be a good idea to include Weil-Felix test in the screening serology protocol although its specificity is very poor.
