The goal of cholera treatment is to replace all the fluids and electrolytes (salts) lost through diarrhea and vomiting. For mild dehydration, a doctor may recommend drinking an over-the-counter rehydration solution. People with more severe cases of cholera may need to stay in the hospital and get intravenous (IV) fluids.Sometimes doctors prescribe antibiotics to treat cholera. The antibiotics are not as important as rehydrating, but they can help shorten the length of time a person is sick. They also might make cholera-related diarrhea less severe. Sometimes doctors also prescribe zinc supplements.
