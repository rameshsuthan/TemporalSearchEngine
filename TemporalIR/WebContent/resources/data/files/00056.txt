The Spanish strain of ebola is temporarily named the Lloviu virus, after the cave in which the bats were found. Substantial bat die-off in French, Spanish and Portuguese caves prompted scientific investigation by Spanish and US scientists.  Researchers found the virus, in a number of dead Miniopterus schreibersii bats, but not in other bat species, or in healthy bats collected from different geographic locations in Spain.
