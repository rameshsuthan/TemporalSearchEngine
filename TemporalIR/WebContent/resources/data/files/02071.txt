MSF’s teams began distributing antimalarials in the western part of Liberia’s capital city on October 25, with the goal of reaching 300,000 people in all. This treatment—artesunate and amodiaquine—is intended for children over the age of six months and adults alike. The medicine is taken for several days for three months.
