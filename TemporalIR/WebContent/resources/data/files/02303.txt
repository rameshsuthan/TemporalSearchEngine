CDC's authority to exercise quarantine and isolation powers for specific diseases derives from the federal Public Health Service Act and a series of presidential Executive Orders most recently updated in 2014. Under these orders, federal quarantine and isolation powers currently apply to the following diseases: Cholera; Diphtheria; infectious Tuberculosis; Plague; Smallpox; Yellow Fever; Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (Lassa, Marburg, Ebola, Crimean-Congo, South American, and others not yet isolated or named); Influenza caused by new or reemergent flu viruses that are causing, or have the potential to cause, a pandemic; and severe acute respiratory syndromes.
