If your child tests positive for hepatitis B virus (HBsAg) over a period more than six months, he is diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B infection. This means your child was not able to get rid of the virus during the acute infection stage, and the virus remains in his blood and liver. Children with chronic hepatitis B can continue to pass the virus to others â€” even though they may not experience any symptoms of the infection. People with chronic hepatitis B are at an increased risk for developing serious liver problems like cirrhosis or liver cancer. Treatments are available to slow the progression of the disease and help prevent liver damage in some people. Interferon alpha and Lamivudine were the first two approved treatments for chronic hepatitis B in the United States. Since then, there have been several other effective oral antiviral medications that have been marketed in the U.S.
