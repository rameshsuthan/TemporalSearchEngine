All of these diseases are treated with antibiotics. Patients begin taking the medication as soon as possible, because a delay in treatment may increase the risk of complications. In more serious cases, often those in which the diagnosis has been delayed, it may be necessary to hospitalize patients and treat them with intravenous * (IV) antibiotics and fluids.The infections typically last from 1 week to several weeks. If they go untreated or if treatment does not begin soon after infection, the disease can linger for months.
