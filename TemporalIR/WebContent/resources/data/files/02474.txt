The nurse, Amber Joy Vinson, spent less than two weeks in a specialized ward at Emory University Hospital before doctors said she was free of the virus, which has infected more than 10,000 people, mostly in West Africa, in an outbreak this year. Ms. Vinson is one of four people to test positive for Ebola in the United States, although hospitals have treated others who got the virus while abroad.
