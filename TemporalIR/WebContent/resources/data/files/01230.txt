Serology tests are the main laboratory tests used to diagnose. They look for a four-fold increase in antibody titer (5,11).The tests available are indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) tests and latex agglutination (LA) tests(5). To diagnose between epidemic typhus and Brill-Zinsser disease since they are both caused by the same organism, the latter is characterized by an anamnesticIgG response (no IgM) (5). Weil-Felix antibodies are produced, but testing for them is uncommon. R. prowazekii can be isolated in a culture, but this too is uncommon and also dangerous (5).
