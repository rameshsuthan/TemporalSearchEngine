Typhus fever or typhus is an acute infection caused by various species of the bacteria Rickettsia. Forms of typhus depend on the particular species of bacteria responsible for the infection.The various forms of typhus have abrupt onsets with typical incubation periods of 1 to 2 weeks. Epidemic typhus outbreaks typically occur where people are crowded together in unsanitary conditions (times of war, military camps, or natural disasters). Outbreaks are more prevalent in the winter months when blankets are shared and more clothing is worn. The disease is serious and can be fatal, particularly in the elderly.
