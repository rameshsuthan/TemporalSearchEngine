There is no approved cure for Ebola anywhere in the world. Nor is there a vaccine available. Rumors about different treatment methods and preventative medications abound. At best, these are ineffective. At worst, they can be dangerous or even deadly. Several people died after drinking large amounts of salt water.

Treatments and vaccines are being developed, but they are in early stages and have not been tested for safety or effectiveness. None are yet approved or widely available. Public health measures - not experimental medications - are the key to controlling this outbreak.
