The chances of contracting Ebola are "almost zero" if proper safety procedures are followed, said Dr. Thomas Geisbert, one of the nation's top Ebola experts working at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston."Without knowing the details, it's difficult to speculate where a breach (in procedure) occurred, but I think it's clear that a breach probably occurred," Geisbert said.Geisbert said that the proper use of gowns, masks and gloves should shield health workers from contact with bodily fluids that carry the Ebola virus. The virus is not airborne and can only be transmitted by direct contact with those fluids.
