Malaria infected persons who donate blood before the onset of clinical symptoms, but after merozoites have entered the blood stream from the liver, can unknowingly transmit malaria through their blood donation. Blood donations from (semi)immune persons without clinical symptoms may also contain malaria parasites. Similarly, malaria may be transmitted by contaminated needles and syringes.
