As of 4 November 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported a total of 13,592 suspected cases and 5,408 deaths,though the WHO believes that this substantially understates the magnitude of the outbreak with true figures numbering three times as many cases as have been reported. The assistant director-general of the WHO warned in mid-October that there could be as many as 10,000 new EVD cases per week by December 2014. Almost all of the cases have occurred in the three initial countries.
