The scientist who identified the Ebola virus from a blood sample of a dying Catholic nun way back in Congo warns that the latest outbreak of Ebola is caused by the deadliest strain of the virus - 9 out of 10 infected will die from it. In an exclusive interview to TOI's Kounteya Sinha, professor Peter Piot, who was 27-years-old when he made the discovery and is now the director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine says the present outbreak is the largest and the longest ever and could soon see it spread across the world including India.
