Assessment of symptoms which typically include a watery diarrhea along with nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps. With time, diarrhea and vomiting leave the patient feeling listless and dehydrated.
The culture method is the gold standard or most recommended test for diagnosis of cholera. Stool samples taken from a patient using a sterile cotton bud are placed on a plate containing TCBS (thiosulphate citrate bile salts) agar, a selective medium that isolates the bacteria from the diarrhea. On incubation, Vibrio cholerae appear as yellow clumps which are then analyzed to detect the exact strain of cholera. This definitive diagnosis allows cholera to be distinguished from other bacterial, protozoal or viral causes of dysentery.
In areas where cholera is endemic, rapid immunochromatographic dipstick testing is often available. This involves placing a dipstick strip into a stool sample and reading the lines it then displays. Cholera is confirmed if two red lines appear on the dipstick, whereas it is ruled out if only one line appears. It takes between 2 and 15 minutes for the test to make a diagnosis.
Diagnosis can also be made on testing blood for antibodies against Vibrio cholerae.
