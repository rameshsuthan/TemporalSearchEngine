Before the distribution, volunteers who live in the neighborhood and who are trained by MSF visit families to explain how the distribution works. They give each family a ticket indicating the number of people living in the same room, which will authorize them to obtain the drugs. A female family member comes to the distribution site to pick up a packet that contains the treatments.
