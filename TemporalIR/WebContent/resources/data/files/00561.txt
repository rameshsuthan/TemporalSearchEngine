If assessment indicates possible Ebola virus infection, take action.
	•	Isolate the patient in a private room with a private bathroom or covered, bedside commode and close the door.
	•	Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
	•	Limit the healthcare personnel who enter the room.
	•	Keep a log of everyone who enters and leaves the patient’s room.
