TKM-Ebola
Dr. Craig Spencer, New York City's first Ebola patient, will be treated with the experimental drug.
Who got it: Dr. Rick Sacra (cured)
What it does: TKM-Ebola, made by Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corporation, works by interfering with Ebola's RNA. Its Phase I clinical trial was halted in July after some subjects had flu-like side effects. On Tuesday, Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corporation announced that it had created a new form of the treatment to be ready by early December, though it is unknown how many doses are going to be made.
