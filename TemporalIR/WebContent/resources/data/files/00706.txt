How can Ebola infections be prevented?
There is currently no licensed vaccine or treatment for EVD.

If you are in a region where an Ebola outbreak has occurred, take these precautions:

1. Avoid direct contact with blood, saliva, vomit, urine and other bodily fluids of people with EVD or unknown illnesses.

Avoid direct contact with bodies of people who died of EVD or unknown illnesses.
Avoid contact with any medical equipment, such as needles, contaminated with blood or bodily fluids.
If you are a healthcare worker, practice strict infection control measures. This includes isolating infected individuals and properly using personal protective equipment (gowns, masks, goggles and gloves).
If you are a healthcare worker, properly use and disinfect instruments and equipment used to treat or care for patients with Ebola - like needles and thermometers - before throwing them out.
2. Avoid close contact with wild animals and avoid handling wild meat.

Avoid potential carriers, both live and dead, since both can spread the virus. Potential carriers of the virus include:

chimpanzees
gorillas
monkeys
forest antelope
pigs
porcupines, and
fruit bats
3. Know the symptoms of EVD and see a healthcare provider if they develop.

Closely monitor your health during and after travel. Seek medical attention immediately if a fever and any other symptoms arise during or after travel.
If you develop symptoms, be sure to tell your healthcare provider that you have travelled to a region where EVD was present.
