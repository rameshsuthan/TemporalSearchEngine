Malaria is one of the leading causes of disease and death in the world. It is estimated that there are over 200 million new cases every year, with 660,000 deaths worldwide (91 per cent in Africa).Malaria occurs extensively in tropical and subtropical regions.It used to exist in the UK but fortunately no longer does.In recent years, about 1,500 people have returned to Britain with malaria that they have contracted abroad - and, of these, an average of 12 die. For this reason it's important to prevent malaria in those travelling to and from the tropics .The malaria parasite, Plasmodium, is a small, single-cell organism (protozoan), which lives as a parasite in man, monkeys and a specific species of mosquito (Anopheles).
