The outbreak in West Africa is claiming about 60 percent of those who are infected, although the virus, which causes severe internal and external bleeding, can have a fatality rate of up to 90 percent. Since Ebola was first recorded in 1976 in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, it has killed more than 2,000 people. The current outbreak is the first in West Africa and the worst in history.
