Symptoms can take up to a month to develop – beginning as typical “flu-like” signs (fever, fatigue, muscle pain) before becoming more severe (vomiting, diarrhoea, organ damage, internal/external bleeding).  On average 50% of Ebola cases result in death, although the mortality rate can be as high as 90%, depending on the source.
