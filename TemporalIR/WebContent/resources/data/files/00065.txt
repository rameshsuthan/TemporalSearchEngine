Peter Piot: In the 38 years since 1976 until this current outbreak of Ebola, there have been something like 1,500 people who died in total. So that's less than 50 deaths per year. Up to now, it was not a real public health problem. This year, nearly 3,000 have died. All 24 previous outbreaks were both time and place limited to very confined communities. Even in the worst case, Ebola Virus would kill 300 people. Here it has involved entire countries, and it has been going on for over nine months now.
