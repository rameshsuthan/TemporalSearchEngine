An estimated 5% of infected patients will develop cholera gravis, ie, severe watery diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration. The stool may contain fecal material early in the course of clinical illness. Vomiting, although a prominent manifestation, may not always be present. Early in the course of the disease, vomiting is caused by decreased gastric and intestinal motility; later in the course of the disease it is more likely to result from acidemia. Cholera can develop in 1-5 days.
