The fact that Ebola is transmitted by bodily fluids and not by the respiratory route provides no guarantee that there won't be an outbreak in the U.S. or Europe. Consider other non-airborne diseases. Polio was responsible for tens of thousands of deaths in the U.S. In 1952, two years before a successful vaccination program arrested it, there were over 60,000 cases reported. Cholera was responsible for hundreds of thousands of cases in the U.S., although at a time when sanitation practices were substandard. Vaccines and antibiotics have largely eliminated typhoid in this country, but prior to their availability, it caused considerable morbidity and mortality. Obviously, there are major epidemiological differences between all these infections, but none of them are generally spread by respiratory droplet—yet all of them have been responsible for serious or even catastrophic outbreaks.
