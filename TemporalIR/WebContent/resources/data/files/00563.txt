In July 2014, a 40-year-old man who had Ebola symptoms flew internationally from Monrovia, Liberia to Lagos, Nigeria while sick. He arrived in Nigeria 20 July. He vomited frequently during the flight and on arrival. The man's sister had died of Ebola in Liberia, and he had unprotected contact with her body fluids before he fell ill and travelled to Nigeria.
The man was hospitalised promptly on arrival in Nigeria at the First Consultant Hospital, Obalende, but died 25 July. Some healthcare staff had close, unprotected contact with the patient prior to realising he may have Ebola - including contact with his body fluids. These people subsequently fell ill. Some died. He spread the virus to medical staff who treated him, a fellow hospital patient, and a protocol officer with whom he had "very close contact". No one on his flight was infected.
