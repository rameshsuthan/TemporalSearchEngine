Identification

Clinical features
There is great variation in the severity of illness produced by each organism. Infection most commonly begins with a papule forming at the site of the bite where the infection was introduced. This usually becomes necrotic and forms a typical black eschar (scab). Four days to two weeks after the bite symptoms begin with fever and malaise followed by adenitis in the lymph glands draining the bite site. As the organisms spread throughout the body, fever, malaise and headache increase and general lymphadenopathy occurs in most cases. About a week after onset the main features are continuous fever, cough and signs of bronchitis or pneumonia, photophobia, conjunctivitis, generalised adenopathy, delirium, deafness and a maculopapular rash most commonly over the trunk and proximal limb parts. Splenomegaly occurs in some cases.

Fever may persist for 14 days without antibiotic treatment. The fatality rate in untreated cases is 1–40%. This increases with age and depends on the infection site, the type of Rickettsiae involved and previous exposure.

Method of diagnosis
In endemic areas the clinical picture is sufficiently distinctive for a clinical diagnosis. A biopsy of the eschar can be used to demonstrate rickettsiae by immunofluorescence. Specific diagnosis is seldom possible early enough to help in the management.

Definitive diagnosis can be made by isolation of the rickettsia after inoculation of the patient’s blood into mice. Serological methods are also available although these need to be interpreted with caution because of cross-reactivity between strains.

Incubation period

The incubation is from two to 14 days. The variation in incubation may be in part related to the inoculum size.
