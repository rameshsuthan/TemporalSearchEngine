Prevention of typhus outbreaks takes a two-pronged approach. Eliminating the carriers and reservoirs of Rickettsia is an important step in prevention. Spraying with insecticides, rodent control measures, and treating soil with insect-repellent chemicals have all been used successfully to prevent typhus outbreaks. In scrub typhus islands, cutting down vegetation has been shown to lessen the incidence of scrub typhus. The second preventative prong is protecting the body from insect bites. Wearing heavy clothing when venturing into potentially insect-laden areas is one way to protect against insect bites; applying insect repellent to the skin is another. Proper personal hygiene, such as frequent bathing and changing of clothes, will eliminate human body lice and thus prevent epidemic typhus. A typhus vaccine is also available; however, this vaccine only lessens the severity and shortens the course of the disease, and does not protect against infection.
