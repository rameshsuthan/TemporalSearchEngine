To protect against immigrant germs, the United States passed the Immigration Act of 1891, an act that excluded those with "criminal records, polygamist, and prostitutes," as well as those with "loathsome or contagious disease." The Immigration Act made clear that the immigrant carried the filth of both moral degradation and disease. The definition of "loathsome and contagious disease" was flexible and ever-changing, including everything from transmissible disease to insanity, senility, varicose veins, and poor eyesight.
