The virus is a gruesome and meticulous killer – a microscopic Patrick Bateman. It attacks nearly every organ and tissue in the body, sparing bone and skeletal muscle, according to the Oxford Journal of Clinical Infectious Diseases. Once the virus has settled in, it slowly converts the body’s collagen to mush and liquefies the under-layers of skin. Blood clots thicken the bloodstream and cause internal and external hemorrhaging. Death comes after the body becomes drained of blood.
