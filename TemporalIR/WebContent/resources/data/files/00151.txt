There are blood tests for Ebola, but they are imperfect. And giving them to everyone arriving from West Africa might well backfire, some experts argue, because some new arrivals could pass the strictest test and then still fall ill days later. Because they had tested negative once, they could easily assume that symptoms like fever, nausea and diarrhea were just a flu. They could then potentially spread Ebola until they became so ill that they were forced to go to an emergency room. Because early treatment is important, it could also endanger their lives.
