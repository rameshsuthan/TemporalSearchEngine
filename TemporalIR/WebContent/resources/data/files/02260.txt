Quarantines have been used in public health since since at least 1377, when the Mediterranean city of Dubrovnik (then known as Ragusa) isolated ships suspected of carrying the Black Plague for a 40-day period before letting them enter their ports. But they aren't widely enacted anymore because they often group whole categories of people together, without any consideration of individual risk, impeding civil liberties.
