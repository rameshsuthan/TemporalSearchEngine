A presumptive bacteriological diagnosis of V. cholerae infection can be made by phase contrast microscopy of a hanging drop preparation of diarrhoeal stool. V. cholerae O1 demonstrates a characteristic spiral motility that is inhibited by O1 agglutinating antisera. This test should only be used by experienced laboratory staff and when examining watery faeces strongly suggestive of cholera.
