As a small American drugs company tries to speed up its manufacture of the experimental Ebola drug ZMapp, more than a dozen other possible treatments are being used to try and combat the deadly disease.. A handful of patients, including American doctor Rick Sacra, have been given TKM-Ebola and a nurse successfully treated in France was reportedly given Favipiravir. Where people have survived, doctors have cautioned that it is impossible to tell whether the treatments were responsible, the high level of care or whether the patients had recovered naturally like almost half of those infected.
Another form of treatment being considered is the transfer of whole blood or plasma from survivors to give their antibodies to Ebola sufferers.
