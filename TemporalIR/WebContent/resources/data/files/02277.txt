Andrew Speaker, a lawyer from Atlanta, was suspected of having extensively multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, a dangerous version of the infectious and deadly respiratory disease. While awaiting test results, Speaker flew to Europe for his wedding and honeymoon, hitting Paris, Athens, Mykonos island, Rome and Prague. Then he flew to Montreal and was able to cross the border to the U.S., where he was put under the first involuntary isolation order since 1963 (that one occurred when a traveler was incorrectly suspected of having smallpox). Speaker apologized to those he'd flown with but insisted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told him he was safe to travel. (CDC disagrees.) Good news: He didn't infect anyone.
