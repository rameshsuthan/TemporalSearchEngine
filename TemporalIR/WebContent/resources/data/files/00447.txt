When the infection attacks, it causes severe damage to the skin. Small white blisters will develop in the skin, along with red spots referred to as maculopapular rash. These spots will progress into becoming bruises as the skin becomes pulpy in texture. Rips will randomly appear as blood easily pours out. The skin is so weak that it easily tears with any movement of the patient. These manifestations will be followed by the skin beginning to liquefy and die. Each skin opening in the body will bleed, no matter how minuscule it isâ€”even needle punctures.
