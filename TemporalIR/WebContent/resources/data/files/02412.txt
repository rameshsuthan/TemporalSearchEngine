Early symptoms of malaria can include irritability and drowsiness, with poor appetite and trouble sleeping. These symptoms are usually followed by chills, then a fever with rapid breathing. The fever may either gradually increase over 1 to 2 days or may rise very suddenly to 105° F (40.6° C) or above. Then, as fever ends and body temperature quickly returns to normal, there's an intense episode of sweating.The same pattern of symptoms — chills, fever, sweating — may repeat at intervals of 2 or 3 days, depending on which particular species of malaria parasite is causing the infection.
