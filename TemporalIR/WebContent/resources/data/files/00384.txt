After an incubation period of about one week, a person infected with typhus develops a headache, chills, prostration, and fever up to 104Â° F. Other symptoms include a rash, conjunctivitis (inflammation of the mucous membrane that lines the inner surface of the eyelids and covers the forepart of the eyeball), and a dry cough. In severe cases, there is renal failure and mental confusion. Death occurs in 10 to 50 percent of the cases, and the mortality rateincreases if the victim is over 60 years old. However, under medical supervision, drug therapy can be very effective. Murine endemic typhus is caused by R. typhi, a microorganism carried by a rat flea.
