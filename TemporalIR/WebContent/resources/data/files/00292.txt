Because of modern sanitation, cases of typhoid fever in the U.S. and other industrialized nations are now rare, but the disease still occurs regularly in nations where sewage treatment is inadequate. In most cases, typhoid fever is not fatal if it is treated with antibiotics, but if left untreated the disease has a mortality rate of 10-30%. The most effective prevention method is proper hygiene and sanitation, but vaccines against the disease are also available.
