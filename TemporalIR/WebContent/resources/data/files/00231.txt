Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, the first Ebola patients to be treated in the United States, arrived at Emory University Hospital in early August after becoming infected with the Ebola virus while providing humanitarian aid in Liberia. Writebol was discharged on Aug. 19; Brantly left the hospital on Aug. 21. A third patient, who did not want to be identified publicly, was transported to Emory on Sept. 9 and was discharged Oct. 19.
Accompanied by beaming family members and amidst hugs and applause from the health care workers who treated her, nurse Amber Vinson departed a press conference at Emory University Hospital on Tuesday as the fourth patient successfully treated for Ebola virus infection here.
