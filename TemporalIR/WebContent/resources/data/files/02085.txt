Some aspects of typhoid are at clear variance from Thucydides' description. Scavenger animals do not die from infection with typhoid, the onset of fever in typhoid is typically slow and subtle, and typhoid generally kills later in the disease course. As typhoid is most commonly transmitted through poor hygiene habits and public sanitation conditions, it is an unlikely cause of a plague emerging in Africa and moving into the Greek city states[clarification needed], as reported by Thucydides.
