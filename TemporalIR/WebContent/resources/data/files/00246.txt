An American infected with Ebola in Sierra Leone has fully recovered and left a special treatment unit at the National Institutes of Health, the NIH said Thursday. A batch of 16 colleagues who were evacuated soon after never were infected and have all been let out of quarantine also, the group they all work for, Partners in Health, said. "The American healthcare worker admitted to the NIH Clinical Center on March 13 with Ebola virus disease was discharged today in good condition after having been successfully treated at the NIH Clinical Center Special Clinical Studies Unit," NIH said in a statement. "The individual is no longer contagious to the community. At the request of the patient, no further information is being provided."
