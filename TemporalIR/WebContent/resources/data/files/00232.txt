Vinson and another nurse who cared for the patient in Dallas, Nina Pham, were the first people to become infected with the Ebola virus in the United States. Pham was transferred to the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, the day after Vinson's transfer to Emory; she was discharged from NIH, free of the virus, on Oct. 24.
