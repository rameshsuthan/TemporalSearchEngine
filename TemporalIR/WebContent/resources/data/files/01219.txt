The standard technique for diagnosing malaria infection is to look for Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes the disease, in a sample of the patient's blood using a microscope. This method requires a trained specialist and is prone to human error. Other available detection techniques are not quantitative and are expensive or impractical to use in the field, especially in developing countries.
