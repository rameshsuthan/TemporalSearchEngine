Dallas officials didn’t skimp when it came to came to Bentley, the Cavalier King Charles spaniel owned by Nina Pham, the first nurse to contract Ebola. The cost of sheltering, feeding and caring for Bentley alone totaled $26,884, according to the city, which included that amount in its total Ebola costs.Some of Bentley’s expenses, about $19,000, were paid for by grants and donations, said Sana Syed, a city spokeswoman. The city is asking the state of Texas to reimburse some of the other costs, which included personal bills for Duncan’s family, hazardous materials response, salaries, supplies and security.U.S. Senator Charles Schumer, the New York Democrat, called last month for the U.S. government to establish a permanent fund to cover any future costs for New York and other cities that find themselves grappling with Ebola. The need to contain the infectious disease is a nationwide imperative, as an inadequate response by an overburdened city could lead to the virus spreading nationwide, he said in a statement.
