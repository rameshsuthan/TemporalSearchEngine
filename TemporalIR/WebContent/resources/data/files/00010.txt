[Ebola outbreak of 2014–15, also called 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa or Ebola outbreak of 2014,  outbreak of Ebola virus disease ravaging countries in western Africa in 2014–15 and noted for its unprecedented magnitude. By mid-March 2015, suspected and confirmed cases totaled more than 25,000, and reported deaths numbered more than 10,000, making the outbreak significantly larger than all previous Ebola outbreaks combined.] The actual numbers of cases and deaths, however, were suspected to be far greater than reported figures. The causative virus was a type of Zaire ebolavirus known as Ebola virus (EBOV)—the deadliest of the ebolaviruses, which originally was discovered in the 1970s in central Africa. EBOV was descended from ebola harboured by fruit bats.
